                    We have had some painful times over the past two years due to the Coronavirus situation.<br> 
                    I encourage students, parents, and teachers who have had this difficult time.<br>
                     This coronavirus situation has become the hardest time for children. During this period,<br> 
                     most children lost their chance to learn because they couldn't go to school.<br> 
                     Some children had to go to shops or workplaces to make money. And some young girls had to<br> 
                     marry for the livehood of their parents and their families. This is very sad<br> 
                     and heartbreaking. I majored in education at a Korean university. I learned about how<br> 
                     important education is in human life through studing education. Korea was also<br> 
                     a very poor country after the war. However, Korean parents did their best to educate their<br> 
                     children, even though they are poor. As a result, their children, who were<br> 
                     well educated by their parents' efforts, did not have to live in poverty anymore.<br>
                      Education is not just necessary to avoid living in poverty. Through education, people<br> 
                     get wisdom and knowledge. Educated people can prepare for the future and create a reliable world.<br> 
                     They know how to love people and become capable porple and change the world.<br> 
                     Our Gloria School will do our best to edycate our students to be the wise, the faithful,<br>
                      the loving and the capable.<br>
